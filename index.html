    <h1>Daniel Budidharma</h1>
    <p>Hi there! My full name is Vincentius Daniel Budidharma, but I prefer to be called <b>Daniel</b>. <br>
        I'm currently a student at UCSD. My interests include machine learning, statistics, and data science. <br>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy watching films and hiking.
